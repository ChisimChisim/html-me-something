					<li>SENSO-JI</li>
				</a>
				<p><strong>Senso-ji</strong> is an ancient Buddhist temple located in Asakusa, Tokyo, Japan. It is Tokyo's oldest temple, and one of its most significant. You can ride a <em>Jinrikisha</em>, a small, two-wheeled, cart-like passenger vehicle with a retractable roof,pulled by one or more person, and they will take you the major sightseeing spots aroung Senso-ji.</p>

			<h2 id="food">Food&Drink</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>RAMEN</li>
				<p>You cannot go to Japan without eating <strong>Ramen</strong>. Think of ramen as the pizza of Japan: a quick, fortifying meal, which may involve standing in line and is then quickly devoured. I'd recommend <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichiran" title="Ichiran" target="_blank">Ichiran</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ippudo" title="Ippudo" target="_blank">Ippudo</a> as you cannot go wrong with these ramen chains.</p>

				<li>SUSHI</li>
				<p>Have you had a <strong>real Sushi</strong> before? Japanese use very fresh fish and tasty rice. I recommend to go to Tsukiji to get fresh row fish (sasimi) or Sushi. Kaiten Sushi (rotating sushi restautant) is also great place to have enjoy Sushi with unique Japanese culture.</p>

				<li>TEMPRA</li>
				<p><strong>Tempura</strong> is seafood or vegetables that have been covered in batter and fried in oil. We eat tempura with by dipping into tempura sauce or with maccha salt.</p>
